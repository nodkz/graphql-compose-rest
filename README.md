## This package was deprecated in favor of better package naming [graphql-compose-json](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-json)

Please run following commands:

```bash
  yarn remove graphql-compose-rest
  yarn install graphql-compose-json
```

And rename your imports:

```diff
- import composeWithRest from 'graphql-compose-rest';
+ import composeWithJson from 'graphql-compose-json';
```

## This package may be re-invented in future if we understand how to implement standard resolvers for fetching data.

If you have some thoughts, please open an issue.
